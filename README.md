# Read comics tracker

## [WIP]

A personal project that tracks read Marvel Comics, just like tracking watched tv shows.

**It requires a Marvel developer API Key.**

It uses strapi and Postgres for a sort of back-end, deployed both on Heroku.

Todo:

- [ ] Improve UI to navigate more pages after 20 issues of a series.
- [ ] Notify save read info success, maybe toastify?
- [ ] Order issues by name (issue number is inside the name). Figure something out
- [ ] Seach issues instead of series
