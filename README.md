# Read comics tracker

## [WIP]

A personal project that tracks read Marvel Comics, just like tracking watched tv shows.

**It requires Marvel developer public and private API Key.**

It uses strapi and Postgres for a sort of back-end, deployed both on Heroku.

Todo:

- [x] ~~Improve UI to navigate more pages after 20 issues of a series.~~
- [x] ~~Notify save read info success, maybe toastify?~~
- [x] ~~Order issues by name (issue number is inside the name). Figure something out~~
- [ ] Seach issues instead of series
- [ ] Somehow intergrate reading orders
